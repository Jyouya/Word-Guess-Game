# Word-Guess-Game

## A javascript based Hangman game

The goal of the game is simple: find the hidden word by guessing letters before it's too late.

Each correct guess puts you closer to solving the word, and each wrong guess adds a line to our hangman.  If the drawing gets completed, it's game over.

To make a guess, just press the key for the letter you want.

The hangman is drawn entirely with css!
